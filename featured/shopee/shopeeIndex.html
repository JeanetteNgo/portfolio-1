        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            This was originally part of a project submission for the Shopee Product & Design Challenge 2021. 
            Participants had about 12 days from the release of the design brief to conceptualize and come up with ideas 
            to improve the current Shopee app. As you can imagine, it was quite the rush having to send out surveys, 
            ideate, prototype, conduct user interviews, and finally flesh out a decent proposal in less than 2 weeks üò≠. 
            <br> <br>
            Now, unconstrained by a deadline and design specifications, I have decided to continue working on what my 
            team had and of course, put it up here as part of my portfolio! Yay! 
        </p>

        <h2> About Shopee </h2>
        <p>
            Launched in 2015, Shopee has grown to become one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia and 
            Taiwan. It boasts a wide selection of products, and offers an easy, secure, and fast online shopping 
            experience for consumers (at least that‚Äôs what Shopee says on their website).
        </p>

        <h2> My Design Process </h2>


        <h2> User Research </h2>
        <p>
            My team administered a survey to a sample size of 39 respondents, asking questions relating to their usage of 
            e-commerce applications. Our sample focuses on Shopee‚Äôs target user group, mostly consisting of young adults 
            in the 21-30 years old range.
        </p>
        <ul>
            The survey sought to: <br>
            <li> understand the average user behaviour and interactions with the Shopee app; </li>
            <li> find out why users might (or might not) prefer the Shopee app over other major e-commerce competitors 
                (such as Lazada and AliExpress); </li>
            <li> identify common user pain points. </li>

        </ul>

        <img src="images/Shopee-Time.JPG" alt="Average browsing time on Shopee">
        <p>
          We discovered most survey respondents to be casual browsers, spending on average less than 30 minutes on the app each time. 
        </p>

        <img src="images/Shopee-Issues.JPG" alt="Issues to fix">
        <p>
          Some of the reasons cited for using Shopee include: convenience, low prices, and abundance of good deals. 
          However, users also identified a few issues they were frustrated with: namely, the lack of reviews for products, 
          lack of ratings for sellers, and a cluttered app interface.
        </p>

        <h2> User Persona and Journey Map </h2>
        <p>
          Based on the key findings gathered from our user research, I created 2 personas and conceptualized a journey 
          map depicting a user‚Äôs behaviour and pain-points when using the app.
        </p>
        <img src="images/PersonaOne.png" alt="Persona One">
        <img src="images/PersonaTwo.png" alt="Persona Two">

        <h2> Problem Definition </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Overly cluttered  homepage </li>
          <li> Excessive ad banners interfering with browsing experience </li>
          <li> Too many different features and sections with no clear distinctions between them </li>
          <li> Lack of product ratings and seller feedback </li>
          <br>
          These pain points contribute to cognitive overload when a user first arrives at the homepage, 
          overcomplicates the browsing process, and makes it harder for the user to make a purchase decision 
          due to insufficient product reviews.
        </ul>

        <h2> Proposed Improvements </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> A more personalized homepage containing only the most important features and listings </li>
          <li> Strategically placed banners and pop-ups that do not overly intrude on a user‚Äôs browsing experience </li>
          <li> More user-friendly layout and neater categorization of features overall </li>
          <li> Rework reminder for users to leave product ratings and seller reviews </li>
        </ul>
